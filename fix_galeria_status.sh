echo ""

echo "📋 Summary of fixes applied:"
echo "✅ Frontend now has debugging and fallback images"
echo "✅ Better error handling and UI improvements"

echo "🎯 Current status:"
echo "• Frontend: Will show placeholder images if API fails"
echo "• CSS: Tailwind should load correctly"
echo "• Debugging: Console logs will show API calls"
echo ""

echo "⏰ After deployment (5-10 minutes):"
echo "1. Go to: https://the-badgers.com/galeria"
echo "2. Open Browser Console (F12)"
echo "3. Look for debug messages:"
echo "   🔍 Galeria DEBUG - API Base: https://thebadgerspage.onrender.com"
echo "   🔍 Galeria DEBUG - Response status: 200"
echo "   🔍 Galeria DEBUG - Items count: X"
echo ""

echo "📊 Expected results:"
echo "• ✅ CSS styles should load (gradients, shadows, responsive grid)"
echo "• ✅ Images should appear (either from API or placeholders)"
echo "• ✅ Clean, modern UI with proper spacing"
echo ""

echo "🐛 If issues persist:"
echo "• CSS not loading → Clear browser cache, try incognito mode"
echo "• Images not loading → Check console for API errors"
echo "• API errors → Backend needs image data in database"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Deployment triggered - check Render dashboard for progress"
